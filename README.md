# Reinforcement-Learning-Based-Intermittent-Androgen-Suppression-Treatment-Strategy-Planning-Method
We propose a reinforcement learning-based IAS treatment planning method to adaptively regulate serum cell dynamics and prevent biochemical recurrence ($\frac{dy}{dt} \geq$ $0.2$ $ng/mL$ for 4 or more consecutive weeks) in various androgen suppression models.
